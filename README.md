# Hope UI

Hope UI is a composable and accessible component library that gives you the foundation to build your next SolidJS application.

# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

Hope UI is in a rewrite process, focus will be on the next major version (`v1.0`) and no new feature will be added to `v0.x`.

Hope UI is **moving away** from CSS-in-JS and style props (Chakra UI like) API, if this is something important to you, consider switching to another solution. 

This project is not ready for production, use at your own risk.
